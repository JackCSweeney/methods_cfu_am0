# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I am most proud of the final challenge in the final_practice.rb file. The process of what was needed to complete it came to me quickly and it worked on the first try!
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
- Once a method is defined, it can be called any time you need it in the future within that project. Meaning that once you have the code built in a method that does what you need it to do to any specific date, you can quickly run new data through that code again at any time.
